# MWCC — current understanding

_The graffito decomp bot's living theory of how the Metrowerks CodeWarrior compiler
(MWCC GC/1.2.5) behaves. Updated by the bot as it observes the compiler. Read by the
bot at the start of every tick alongside `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`._

This file is **not** authoritative — `CLAUDE.md` is. This is where the bot accumulates
its working hypotheses, open questions, and confirmed observations as it works. When a
hypothesis here becomes well-established with multiple independent confirmations, it
should be promoted into `CLAUDE.md` and removed from here.

## Structure

Organise the content under exactly these three top-level sections. Don't add new
top-level sections — extend the existing ones. If you want a deeper hierarchy, use
H3 (`###`) inside a section.

- **Settled** — observations confirmed across at least two independent TUs. Each
  entry is a one-paragraph statement of the rule with a citation list (TU/function
  names where it was observed). These are candidates for promotion to `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Hypotheses under investigation** — patterns the bot has noticed but isn't yet
  sure about. Each entry explains the hypothesis and the specific experiment that
  would confirm or refute it.
- **Open questions** — phenomena the bot doesn't understand yet. Each entry is a
  question + the symptom that prompted it. Move to "Hypotheses under investigation"
  when an idea forms.

Within each section, order entries newest-first (prepend, don't append). Old entries
that turned out wrong should be moved to a `## Refuted / wrong turns` section at the
bottom rather than deleted — preserving the dead-ends prevents the bot from re-trying
them in future ticks.

## Settled

_(empty — populate as observations confirm)_

## Hypotheses under investigation

_(empty — populate as patterns emerge)_

## Open questions

_(empty — populate as new mysteries appear)_

## Refuted / wrong turns

_(empty — populate when a former hypothesis is disproved)_

## Conventions for entries

- **Lead with the rule, not the story.** "MWCC does X when Y" is more useful than "I
  spent 30 min on Z and figured out X". Save the story for the journal.
- **Cite specific symbols.** `SMS_IsMarioOnWire__Fv`, `flip__8TTimeRecFv`, etc. —
  fully mangled names so anyone (human or future agent) can grep the codebase.
- **Quantify when you can.** "+16 bytes of phantom stack inflation" beats "extra
  stack". "lwz then lwz at the same offset" beats "two loads".
- **Distinguish confirmed from suspected.** In _Settled_, only put things observed
  in two or more places. In _Hypotheses_, lead with "Hypothesis:".
- **Link related entries.** When extending an entry, cross-reference rather than
  duplicate. Use `(see also: <heading>)`.
- **Date entries are not needed** — git history serves that purpose. The structural
  order (newest first within each section) gives readers the sense of "what's been
  on the bot's mind recently".
